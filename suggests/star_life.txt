A star's lifecycle begins in a giant molecular cloud, a cold and dense region filled with gas and dust. Gravity causes the densest parts of the cloud to collapse, forming a protostar. As the protostar contracts, its core temperature and pressure increase. When the core temperature reaches about 10 million degrees Celsius, nuclear fusion ignites, converting hydrogen into helium and releasing energy. This marks the birth of a main-sequence star, where it will spend most of its life in a stable state, balancing gravitational forces with the outward pressure from nuclear fusion.

For stars like the Sun, this phase lasts billions of years. Eventually, the hydrogen in the core depletes, causing the core to contract and heat up further. The outer layers expand, and the star becomes a red giant. In this phase, helium fusion begins in the core, producing carbon and oxygen. The outer layers may be ejected, creating a planetary nebula, while the core becomes a white dwarf, a dense, cooling remnant. Over time, the white dwarf will fade into a cold, dark black dwarf, although the universe is not old enough for any black dwarfs to exist yet.

For more massive stars, the lifecycle is shorter and more violent. After exhausting hydrogen, these stars become red supergiants. They undergo successive stages of fusion, creating heavier elements up to iron. Iron cannot fuse to release energy, leading to the core's collapse under gravity. This collapse triggers a supernova explosion, scattering elements into space and leaving behind a neutron star or, if massive enough, a black hole. Neutron stars are incredibly dense remnants where protons and electrons have merged into neutrons. Black holes, on the other hand, have gravity so strong that not even light can escape.

Throughout a star's lifecycle, it plays a crucial role in the universe. The elements created within stars and scattered by supernovae contribute to the formation of new stars, planets, and even life. This stellar recycling enriches the interstellar medium with heavier elements, ensuring that subsequent generations of stars and planetary systems have a diverse chemical composition. The lifecycle of a star, from its birth in a molecular cloud to its final stages as a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole, is a testament to the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the cosmos.
